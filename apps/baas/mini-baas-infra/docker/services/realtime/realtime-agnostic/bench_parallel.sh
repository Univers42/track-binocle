#   ./bench_parallel.sh          # Run all 3 groups in parallel
#   ./bench_parallel.sh micro    # Run only the micro group
#   ./bench_parallel.sh filter   # Run only the filter group
#   ./bench_parallel.sh registry # Run only the registry group
#
# NOTE: Parallel benchmarks share CPU resources, so individual numbers
# may have slightly higher variance than sequential runs. For precise
# A/B comparisons, use the sequential all-in-one:
#   cargo bench -p realtime-engine --bench engine_bench
