//! # realtime-gateway
//!
//! WebSocket gateway, connection lifecycle management, fan-out pipeline, and REST API
//! for the Realtime-Agnostic event engine.
//!
//! This crate handles the entire client-facing surface:
//!
//! - **WebSocket handling** ([`ws_handler`]) — Connection upgrade, authentication,
//!   subscribe/unsubscribe, event delivery, and client PUBLISH.
//! - **Connection management** ([`connection`]) — Per-connection bounded send queues,
//!   overflow policies (DropNewest/DropOldest/Disconnect), backpressure isolation.
//! - **Fan-out** ([`fanout`]) — N-worker pool that reads dispatch instructions from
//!   the event router and writes events to per-connection channels.
//! - **REST API** ([`rest_api`]) — HTTP endpoints for publishing events and health checks.
//!
//! ## Backpressure Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! EventRouter → dispatch_tx(65536) → FanOutWorkerPool(N workers)
//!                                    → conn_manager.try_send(conn_id, event)
//!                                      → per-connection mpsc(256) → WS writer_loop
//! ```
//!
//! Each connection has an independent bounded queue. A slow client never blocks others.
