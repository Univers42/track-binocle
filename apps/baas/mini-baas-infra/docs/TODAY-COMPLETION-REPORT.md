## Work Completed

All planned deliverables for March 31 are complete:

| Deliverable | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Endpoint specification frozen (10 API routes) | Done |
| Data models defined (PostgreSQL + MongoDB) | Done |
| PostgreSQL schema validated and RLS policies fixed | Done |
| MongoDB service audited against specification | Done |
| Kong gateway route for `/mongo/v1` confirmed | Done |
| Docker Compose setup verified | Done |
| Integration test suite created (22 test cases) | Done |
| Execution plan documented for April 1 | Done |

---

## Endpoint Specification

The specification covers 10 API routes across three domains:

| Domain | Routes |
|--------|--------|
| Authentication | `/auth/v1/signup`, `/auth/v1/token`, `/auth/v1/health` |
| PostgreSQL | `/rest/v1/projects` — `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` |
| MongoDB | `/mongo/v1/collections/:name/documents` — 6 operations |

Full specification: [MVP-Schema-Specification.md](MVP-Schema-Specification.md)

---

## Data Models

| Database | Table / Collection | Purpose |
|----------|--------------------|---------|
| PostgreSQL | `projects` | MVP demo — project CRUD with RLS |
| PostgreSQL | `users` | User identity (managed by GoTrue) |
| PostgreSQL | `user_profiles` | Extended user metadata |
| PostgreSQL | `posts` | Content model with visibility control |
| MongoDB | `tasks` | MVP demo — user-isolated documents |
| MongoDB | `notes` | Document storage example |
| MongoDB | `events` | Event log example |

All tables enforce `owner_id` matching — at the database layer (PostgreSQL RLS) or the application layer (MongoDB service).

---

## PostgreSQL Schema Changes

**File:** `scripts/db-bootstrap.sql`

Changes made during this session:

1. Added the `projects` table with the MVP schema.
2. Removed the `OR true` bypass from RLS policies — all policies now enforce strict ownership.
3. Added grants for the `projects` table to the `authenticated` role.
4. Verified the `auth.uid()` JWT extraction function.

Before and after:

```sql
-- Before: policy allowed unrestricted reads
CREATE POLICY users_select_own ON public.users
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid()::text = id::text OR true);

-- After: strict ownership enforcement
CREATE POLICY users_select_own ON public.users
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid()::text = id::text);
```

## MongoDB Service Audit

**File:** `docker/services/mongo-api/server.js`

The service was audited against the endpoint specification. Results:

| Component | Compliant |
|-----------|-----------|
| All 6 CRUD endpoints | Yes |
| Response envelope (`success`, `data`, `error`, `meta`) | Yes |
| 13 specific error codes | Yes |
| JWT Bearer token extraction and HS256 verification | Yes |
| Tenant isolation via `owner_id` on all operations | Yes |
| Input validation (collection names, ObjectIds, 256 KB limit) | Yes |
| Forbidden field protection (`_id`, `owner_id`) | Yes |
| Automatic timestamps (`created_at`, `updated_at`) | Yes |

No code changes were needed. Full report: [Mongo-Service-Validation.md](Mongo-Service-Validation.md)

---

## Kong Route Configuration

The Kong declarative config already contains the route for the MongoDB service:

```yaml
- name: mongo-api
  url: http://mongo-api:3010
  routes:
    - name: mongo-api-routes
      paths: [/mongo/v1]
      strip_path: true
  plugins:
    - name: key-auth
      config: { key_names: [apikey] }
    - name: rate-limiting
      config: { minute: 180, hour: 5000 }
```

No changes were required.

---

## Docker Compose Verification

All core services confirmed operational:

| Service | Image | Port | Health |
|---------|-------|------|--------|
| postgres | postgres:16 | 5432 | SQL ping |
| gotrue | gotrue:latest | 9999 | HTTP health |
| kong | kong:3.8 | 8000 | Declarative config loaded |
| mongo | mongo:7 | 27017 | mongosh ping |
| mongo-api | node:18 | 3010 | Depends on mongo health |
| postgrest | postgrest:latest | 3000 | HTTP health |
| realtime | realtime:latest | 4000 | HTTP health |
| minio | minio:latest | 9000 | HTTP health |

All services are configured with the `mini-baas` bridge network, health-check dependencies, named volumes, and environment variables from `.env`.

## Test Suite

**File:** `scripts/phase15-mongo-mvp-test.sh`

22 test cases covering:

| Category | Tests | Coverage |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Auth and gateway security | 3 | API key validation |
| User setup | 4 | Signup and login for two users |
| CRUD operations | 5 | Create, list, get, update, delete |
| User isolation | 4 | Cross-user access prevention |
| Input validation | 6 | Invalid names, oversized payloads, forbidden fields |

Run command: `bash scripts/phase15-mongo-mvp-test.sh`

---

## Files Changed

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `scripts/db-bootstrap.sql` | Added projects table, fixed RLS policies |
| `docs/MVP-Schema-Specification.md` | New specification document |
| `docs/Mongo-Service-Validation.md` | New audit report |
| `docs/TOMORROW-EXECUTION-PLAN.md` | New execution plan |
| `scripts/phase15-mongo-mvp-test.sh` | New test suite (22 tests) |

---

## Next Steps

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
